Process outline:

Use a planerized Street Grid.
Use a projected ED or Block polygon shapefile.

Step 1: Now, we will create a hexagon grid with a custom tool that someone posted on the ESRI site. 
Navigate to the _Exchange drive in Windows, and double click on “Create_Hexagon_Tessellation.” 
The tool becomes available in ArcMap under the geoprocessing results. 
This window appears in Arc once you open the file from the exchange drive:

Double click on the tool here to open it. 
•	For “Study Area,” select the ED polygons for your city that end with “edt.”
•	Specify the side length
•	Save the resulting file as “hex###” in your city’s folder, where ### is the number used to specify the side length (e.g. hex150 for sides of 150m).
Now, search for the “Feature to Point” tool, and choose your new hexagon file as the input. Save your output as “centroid###” in the folder you’re working with. This creates the centroids for the hexagons.

Step 2: Finally, we attach an ID from each centroid onto the segments that fall closest to it. Open the attribute table of the “centroid###” points, and create a new field. Make it a long integer, and call it “hexid###”. Right click on the field name in the table, and click on “Field Calculator.” Click on the FID field in the calculator, make the formula read “[FID]+1” and calculate the variable. 

Next, open the “Spatial Join” tool from the search bar.
•	The “Target Features” is “citynamest_segment”
•	The “Join Features” is “centroid###”
•	Save the output in the city folder as “citynamest_join###”
•	Make sure the join operation is “JOIN_ONE_TO_ONE”
•	Set the match option to “CLOSEST”

Run the function, and the resulting file has street segments grouped by their hexid!
