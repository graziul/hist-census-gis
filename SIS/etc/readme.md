# Other SIS-related code #

Nate Frey, July 2017

This directory contains a couple of pieces of SIS-related code that aren't associated with the main SIS directories. These include
"neighborindex.R", which generates Logan and Parman's "Neighbor Index" variant of the SIS concept, and calc_hisp_30_40.R, which 
tabulates Hispanic populations in our SIS cities, something John requested for a grant he is writing.
